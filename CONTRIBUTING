# How to contribute

Being an open source project means any help offered will be greatly appreciated, below is a quick run through of how you
can help

## Getting Started

* Fork the latest branch of the component you want to contribute to
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Make sure you have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed
* Use virtualenv to install all requirements from the requirements.txt file
* Fix the issue you \ add a feature
* Make sure the unittests pass & that code coverage didn't drop (you add it, you write the unit test for it)
* Create a pull request
* Once merged the next version release will have your changes in it

## Design philosophy
drone-kubernetes-apply is designed with the following philosophy in mind, any feature\pull requests will be judged against the following:

* Follow Linux philosophy and have each component do one thing & one thing only.
* Reliability is more important then shiny new features.
* No vendor\cloud lock-in, if it's only available in one cloud it will not be used.

### Documentation

drone-kubernetes-apply docs are hosted at the repo docs/ folder, reading them is highly recommended
prior to making any pull requests

## What you can help with

* Documentation - everyone hates them but without them would you be able to figure out how to use drone-kubernetes-apply?
* Bug fixes / feature requests - anything off github issues lists
* Submitting tickets - even if you don't have the time\knowledge to fix a bug just opening a github issue about it will greatly help
* Suggesting improvements
* Spreading the word

### Summary

* Your awesome for helping, thanks.

P.S.
Don't forget to add yourself to to CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
